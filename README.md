As an assignment for a class, I built a version of the game Ghost (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(game)). This version I created allows for as many players as want to play, with a round ending when all but one player are out. During the round, when other players are knocked out, they continue to play as "ghost" players. The "ghost" players cannot win at this point, but they can aid other players in winning (or losing). At the end of each round, all players who lost receive a letter. The first player to get "Ghost" loses, and the person(or people) who has the lowest amount of letters at that point wins.
